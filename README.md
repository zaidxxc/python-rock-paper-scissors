# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game 🎮
My second Python project! A classic game played against the computer.

### 🛠 Technical Concepts Used:
- **Randomization:** Used the `random` module for computer moves.
- **Game Loops:** Implemented `while` loops to keep the game running until a score is reached.
- **Conditional Logic:** Complex `if/elif` structures to determine the winner.
- **Input Handling:** Validating user choices.
